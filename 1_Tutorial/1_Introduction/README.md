# What is a Css?

### Css stands for Cascading Style Sheets

### Css describes how Html elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in the media

### Css saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once

### Css is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes

### Example

body {
background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
color: white;
text-align: center;
}

p {
font-family: verdana;
font-size: 20px;
}

### h1-Selector, {color:blue;}-declaration color-property, blue-value

### The selector points to the Html element you want to style

### The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons

### Eich declaration includes a Css property name and a value, seperated by a colon

### Multiple Css declarations are seperated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces

### In the example all <p> elements will be center-align, with a red text color

p {
color: red;
text-align: center;
}
